## Group 5 
### Project Title: WTF ==> Local Weather, and Food App
### Project Description ==>  A user can enter a location in the app.  Based on the location, the user will be provided with the local weather and food choices.  
### Benefits ==> As a traveler, I can enter the location of where I am traveling, and check on the local weather,  and food choices.   This will allow me to not have to navigate to multiple apps to get the information required.

## User Story: 
AS A traveler
I want to be able to enter a location which will give me the local weather and restaurants options.
So that I can make an educated decision based on the options given to me.
Project Requirements:
